# Pseudo Calculator
A calculator + REPL made in Godot 3.4.4.

Inspired by [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/u9cuup/gui_calculator_26_lines_of_code_mit_showcasing/) where some commenters got triggered by arbitrary code execution.

A [web build](https://fakefirefly.itch.io/pseudo-calculator) is available on itch.io. This is actually where arbitrary code execution starts becoming a concern, as Godot exposes a Javascript interface to the user/developer for web builds.
